# Javascript DOM Exercises
**Focus**: JS | **Authors**: Dylan H

These exercises are designed to get you familar with making changes to the DOM. You should open the file in your browser by copying the absolute file path of ex(1|2|3).html and pasting it into the top bar.
## Exercise 1
For this exercise change **ex1.js**. Use javascript to change the following things on the html page

- Link the javascript into the html
- Add your name in the h2 element with id #name
- Make the text bigger and green
- Change the img src to show a photo of a cat
- Change the style of all of the squares so that they appear on the page

## Exercise 2
For this exercise alter both **ex2.js** and **ex2.html** so that when button(x) is pressed it will fill in the center box with the corresponding html.

**Bonus ⭐**: Make it so that the text fills in when the mouse leave the button instead of the click event. What happens if you add another button?

## Exercise 3
Complete the fetch code in **ex3.js**. Add the friendly advice from the API to the given box.

**Bonus ⭐**: Try using [another api](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?)! You could also try to use an api that takes an input and combine that with a text input.
