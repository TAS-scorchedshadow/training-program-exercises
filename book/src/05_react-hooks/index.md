# React Hooks

In the [introduction to React](../04_react-intro/index.md), we learned a bit about
how the overall *syntax* of React worked (with JSX), and how HTML and JavaScript
can be blended together to create reusable components that can be dynamically
generated. In these exercises, however, we will be covering **hooks** - a React
feature that makes webpages truly dynamic.

## What is a hook?

In React, a hook allows components to use React features, written as a function
call. We have the following exercises to help you familiarise yourself with what
these hooks actually do, and how to use them:

- [`useState` and `useEffect`](./state_and_effect/index.md)

For more information, you can have a look at the [official React documentation for hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).
