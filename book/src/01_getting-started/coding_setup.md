# Setting up a Coding Environment

To start learning and coding we of course need a proper work environment. This is highly customisable however this guide will only cover some basics and recommendations to get you going.

It is highly encouraged to set some time aside to configure your personal coding environment. This will not only improve your workflow but also allow you to customise everything from the aesthetics to shortcuts.

This will be split into two main parts for the most common operating systems: Windows and macOS. If you are using a Linux system this will not be too applicable, as you do not have to set up anything specific. However you are welcome to check out [Customise the Command Line Prompt](./windows.md#customise-the-command-line-prompt).

Please select the guide for your operating system and enjoy! Both of these guides will assume a start from scratch.

- [Windows](./windows.md)
